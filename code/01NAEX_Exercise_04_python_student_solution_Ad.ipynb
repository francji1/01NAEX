We typically expect blocks to be different; if they weren't, blocking might not have been necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. No Specific Questions about Blocks: In most experimental designs, the research questions focus on the treatments. You want to know which additives are different, not necessarily which cars are different from each other. While the ANOVA tells us the cars collectively introduce significant variability, the specific pairwise differences between 'Car1' and 'Car2', or 'Car3' and 'Car5', are usually not relevant to the main objective of the experiment (studying additive performance)."

        " Despite the overall ANOVA indicating a statistically significant difference among the additive types (your p=0.0012 < 0.05), the Tukey HSD test shows that none of the specific pairwise comparisons between any two additives are statistically significant at your chosen alpha level of 0.05.\n",
        "\n",
        " However after closer inspection of the box plot and Tukey's HSD test, it is apparent that the group 5 has the worst milage across all cars and all additives. Also Tukey test shows, that 1st and 5th additive exhibit marginal difference, approaching significance (with p-value of 0.0533).\n",
        "\n",
        " Therefore, while an overall effect of additive type on mileage exists, specific additives cannot be declared definitively superior or inferior to one another based on this analysis. This implies that if the observed trends, particularly between Additive 1 and 5, are of practical importance, further investigation with more data may be warranted."
